# AGENTS.md

## Local overrides

If `AGENTS.local.md` exists at the repo root, read it and let its instructions take precedence over
this file. It is gitignored for personal, machine-specific preferences and never committed.

## Project

A Claude Code mod: a plugin whose hooks module Claude Code loads from source, with no build step.

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the manifest; `hooks/hooks.json` names the hooks module;
  `types/index.d.ts` is the contract for the values the mod keeps in `$.state`.
- The hooks module runs in Claude Code's own environment: no Node, no DOM, no `require`. Everything
  outside the module is reached through the `$` argument of a hook.
- JSX compiles against the global `h`, never React. Elements come from `$.ui.resolve(e)`.
- Tests import their kit from `claude-code/testing` and run only under `claude plugin test`.
- The API's TypeScript declarations are Claude Code's own and are never committed. Claude Code
  writes them to `.claude-plugin/types/` (gitignored) each time it loads the mod. Set them up with
  `npm run declarations`, which starts the Claude Code version pinned in `package-lock.json` with
  this folder loaded; quit it once it has started. This needs a logged-in Claude Code. Without one,
  run `LEFTHOOK_EXCLUDE=declarations,type,typelint npm run check`, which skips the guard, `tsc`, and
  the type-aware lint, as CI does. Nothing has to be remembered: `npm run check` names the command
  when the declarations are missing and notes it when another Claude Code version wrote them.

## Commands

- `npm test` — `claude plugin test .`; runs every `*.test.ts` and `*.test.tsx` against the engine
- `npm run check` — every pre-commit hook over all tracked and untracked files: lint, markdown,
  formatting, workflow lint/audit, type-aware lint, dead code, spelling, types, then the mod's own
  load check (`claude plugin validate --strict`). The lint, markdown, and formatting hooks rewrite
  files in place. Run before committing.
- `npm run fix` — auto-fix lint, markdown, and formatting, then remove unused exports, dependencies,
  and enum members (`fallow fix`). Deletes code — review the diff before committing.
- `npm run check:security` — surface security candidates (`fallow security`). Candidates need
  verification; they are not confirmed vulnerabilities. Not part of `check`.

## Git hygiene

- Never run `git commit --no-verify`, `git commit -n`, or anything else that skips the lefthook
  hooks — the hooks are the gate, not an obstacle.
- Fix a failing check at its source. Never edit a test to make it pass; never widen a lint ignore to
  silence a real finding.

## Linter and type-checker configuration

Treat lint and type-check config as fixed. Never add to an ignore list, disable a rule, lower a
severity, or exclude a file to get a check passing — fix the code instead. A suppression is
warranted only when the finding is a genuine false positive or the rule cannot apply (e.g. a
generated file, a documented upstream bug); then suppress at the narrowest scope — an inline
directive with a reason — not in the shared config. When the same inline directive keeps recurring
for the same rule, that is a signal the rule may deserve a config-level ignore — propose it to the
user and wait for explicit approval; never promote a suppression into config on your own.

## Doc comments

TSDoc. None is required on private functions, parameterless void functions, or non-function symbols.
A one-line doc comment is complete on its own — no `@param`, `@returns`, or `@throws` tags — when
the signature says the rest. When a function needs more than one line (a side effect, an invariant, a
precondition, what `undefined` means, or behavior the name does not convey), use a multi-line doc
comment with tags: `@param` for every parameter, however obvious its name, `@returns`, and `@throws`
for every error thrown or propagated. Parameters, return values, and errors are described only in
their tags, never in prose. A function you edit gets its doc comment brought to this shape even if
you did not write it; deadlines and reviewer preference do not change that. Tests: no doc comments on
test cases, the title carries the intent; shared helpers get a one-line summary.

## Spelling (cspell)

Treat a cspell failure as a prompt to reword, not to grow the dictionary. Prefer plain words in
prose and identifiers. A word earns a `cspell.json` entry only when it comes from outside the
project and cannot be renamed — command names, API identifiers, file formats, proper nouns, domain
vocabulary (e.g. `taskkill`, `unref`, `tsbuildinfo`). In tests, never invent gibberish that needs a
suppression — any real word works for an unknown command, a bogus flag, or filler data, so pick one
(`banana`, not an invented pseudo-word). `// cspell:disable-line` is reserved for fixtures where the
gibberish itself is the behavior under test, never a dictionary entry.
